### Centrifugal Pump Assembly Design  

This repository contains the 3D model and detailed 2D drawing files for a centrifugal pump assembly, created using **SolidWorks**. The design was inspired by the work of **Augusto Brozoski**, whose insightful content on mechanical assemblies has been an excellent resource for learning and design.  

The 3D parts in this repository were generated using 2D drawings, which are included in PDF format, making it ideal for educational purposes and practice in CAD modeling.
